\title{Simulate package transitions for Sankey examples}
\usage{
simulate(
  n,
  int = c("cm", "itn", "irs", "chem", "vaccine"),
  current = c("cm", "itn"),
  weights = c(itn = 0.6, chem = 0.4, vaccine = 0.2, irs = 0.5)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of independent simulations to draw.}

\item{int}{Character vector giving the ordered set of all possible packages.}

\item{current}{Character vector of packages present at the baseline step.}

\item{weights}{Named numeric vector of selection probabilities for packages
in \code{int}. Values should lie between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing one row per step and simulation id.
}
\description{
Generate stochastic sequences of package adoption to help demonstrate Sankey
diagrams. Each simulation begins from \code{current} packages and explores
removals and additions until all packages in \code{int} have been visited.

\examples{
set.seed(1)
simulate(2)
