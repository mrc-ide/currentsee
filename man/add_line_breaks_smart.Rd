\title{Add smart line breaks to text strings}
\usage{
add_line_breaks_smart(x, width = 80, break_words = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector. Text strings to wrap with line breaks}

\item{width}{Integer. Maximum line width in characters (default: 80)}

\item{break_words}{Logical. If TRUE, breaks long words at character boundaries.
If FALSE (default), attempts to break at word boundaries and only forces
character breaks for words longer than width}
}
\value{
Character vector of the same length as input with line breaks added
using "\\n" characters. NA values are returned unchanged.
}
\description{
Intelligently wraps text strings by adding line breaks at appropriate positions.
Can break at word boundaries (default) or force character-based breaking for long words.
Handles NA values and strings shorter than the specified width gracefully.
}
