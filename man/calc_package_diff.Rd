\title{Calculate package differences between two package sets}
\usage{
calc_package_diff(from_pkg, to_pkg, direction = "add")
}
\arguments{
\item{from_pkg}{Character vector. Source package combinations as comma-separated
strings (e.g., "pkg1, pkg2, pkg3").}

\item{to_pkg}{Character vector. Target package combinations as comma-separated
strings. Must be the same length as \code{from_pkg}.}

\item{direction}{Character string. Direction of comparison, either \code{"add"}
(default) to find packages in \code{to_pkg} but not in \code{from_pkg}, or \code{"remove"}
to find packages in \code{from_pkg} but not in \code{to_pkg}.}
}
\value{
Character vector of the same length as input vectors. Each element
contains the comma-separated list of package differences, or \code{NA_character_}
if \code{to_pkg} contains \code{NA} values.
}
\description{
Computes the difference between two sets of comma-separated package strings,
identifying which packages were added or removed when transitioning from one
package combination to another. Useful for tracking package changes in
step-wise analyses or Sankey diagram workflows.
