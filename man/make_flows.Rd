\title{Create flow transitions for bidirectional Sankey diagrams}
\usage{
make_flows(x, nodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame containing intervention scaling data where columns represent
different intervention states (named with numeric values: negative for removal
steps, 0 for current state, positive for addition steps) and rows represent
individual flow paths through the intervention scaling process}

\item{nodes}{Data frame containing node information}
}
\value{
Data frame containing detailed flow information with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{flow_start}, \code{flow_end}: Character. Source and destination node names
\item \code{direction}: Character. Flow direction ("up" or "down")
\item \code{n}: Integer. Number of individual transitions for this flow
\item \code{*_start}, \code{*_end}: Numeric. Coordinate boundaries for flow start and end points
\item \code{flow_start_center}, \code{flow_end_center}: Numeric. Center positions of flows
\item \code{label_x}, \code{label_y}: Numeric. Optimal label positioning coordinates
\item \code{hjust}: Numeric. Horizontal text alignment (0 for left, 1 for right)
\item \code{flow_label}: Character. Custom flow descriptions (if available in flow_labels)
}
}
\description{
Processes intervention scaling data to generate flow transitions between nodes
in both upward (adding interventions) and downward (removing interventions)
directions. Calculates flow positions, coordinates, and label placements while
minimizing visual crossings through intelligent sorting algorithms.
}
\details{
The function performs several key operations:
\itemize{
\item Identifies upward transitions (positive column progressions) representing intervention additions
\item Identifies downward transitions (negative column progressions) representing intervention removals
\item Calculates flow frequencies and positions within source and destination nodes
\item Applies intelligent sorting to minimize visual flow crossings
\item Determines appropriate label positioning and alignment based on flow direction
\item Joins with external flow_labels data for custom flow descriptions
}

Flow positioning uses a two-pass sorting algorithm: first sorting flows within
each source node by destination position, then sorting flows within each
destination node by source position. This approach significantly reduces
visual crossing of flow ribbons in the final Sankey diagram.
