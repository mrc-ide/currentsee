- `fig.width/fig.height` control the widget’s internal pixel size (12 in × 6 in ≈ 1152 × 576 px).
- `out.width='100%'` makes it scale to the article column width without overflowing.
- Remove any previous `width="100%"` you were passing to `sankeyNetwork()` — it fights with the policy.

## If you still want a wider article column
Optionally add a tiny pkgdown CSS so the column itself is a bit wider:

`inst/pkgdown/extra.css`
```css
.article .contents { max-width: 1100px; }
.article .contents .html-widget { width: 100% !important; }
